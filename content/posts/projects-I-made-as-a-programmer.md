## üîç An overview

Going through my projects folder and recollecting memories of all my old projects was refreshing and rewarding. I found that, I had made 9 projects. Out of which, only 2 were done (By done, I mean it reached a state where I was satisfied).

The complete information about each project can be found on  [projects](https://justfahad.me/projects/) page

Here I will list all their names and a one-word explainer:

- Mount Bot: A multipurpose discord bot

- Fassionate: Data sharing ecosystem (with retention)

- Grim Bot: A bit more advanced discord bot

- Brainwave: 2D pixel-art game

- Wallbound: 2D maze game

- Encore: First solo game
