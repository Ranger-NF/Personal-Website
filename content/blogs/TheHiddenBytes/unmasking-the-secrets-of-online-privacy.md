## What's the Buzz about Online Privacy? 🤔
For me, it is to be free from the control of big tech companies. 🕊

"Why though?" (you might ask), You see, Almost every giant out there is hoarding data about your online interactions 👀. This data, most of the time, will be used by them to show user-targeted ads and other personalized targeting.

Here is the kicker - data breaches are like uninvited guests crashing the party and governing bodies are like: "Hand over the loot!" 🚓 . Sadly, this drama is on replay in recent times.

I started diving into all kinds of articles about the rebel of operating systems! 🐧
