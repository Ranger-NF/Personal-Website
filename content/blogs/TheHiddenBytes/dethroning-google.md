Browsing the vast expanse of the internet has become an integral part of life and for many, Google stands tall as the undisputed search giant. Likewise, Google Chrome reigns as the go-to browser. 🔍

But, dear reader, let me whisk you away to the world of alternates where your digital adventures await! 🌟

## 🌟 Enter Startpage: The Stealthy Search Companion
[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/en/about-us), a private search engine, stealthily delivers the same search results as that of Google, all while keeping your _weird_ searches under wraps. It's been my trusty search companion for nearly a year, and I adore it. Fast, responsive, and secure — What more could you ask for? 🚀

While there are alternatives like [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), I find it a tad sluggish. Feel free to dive deeper into various search engines with insights from [itsfoss](https://itsfoss.com/privacy-search-engines/)!

## 🦊 Bidding Farewell to Chrome

Google Chrome, a memory hog with a side of controversial [anti-competitive policies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4gXhmzQztE). Refusing to play along in the drama, I searched for the best alternative, leading me to [Brave](https://brave.com/) and my daily companion, the one and only [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). 🫂

Why Firefox, you ask? I blame [Chromimum's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) monopoly and its connection with, you guessed it, Google. Monopolies, my friend, are bad — they get too comfy, too quick (overly simplified perspective). Plus, there's the whole manifest V3 saga (a story for another day). 😅

Long story short, I personally dislike Google.

Much like search engines, a plethora of browser alternatives exist. peep [itsfoss's comparison of browsers](https://itsfoss.com/best-browsers-ubuntu-linux/) (It includes Chrome & Chromium + some browsers mentioned in it may not be available to all platforms).
