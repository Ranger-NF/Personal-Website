## ðŸš€ Big Dreams
Having a basic foundation on how to code at an early stage, I was excited to join an engineering college, expecting a place where I can connect and spend time with like minded techies. ðŸ™ƒ

## ðŸ˜¶ Realisation
When I began my college life, I quickly realised that engineering colleges - that too having computer science and IT departments - doesn't work like what is potrayed in the society/internet. People here, although are bright minded and super chill are not really into tech.

Majority of the students joined Computer Science/IT just because they weren't able to get into their main goal. ie, they saw BTech as a fallback option (No offence, this is what I observed)

## ðŸ¤© Step back
On the bright side, I see this as an opportunity, a chance to build and lead an active community. Works has been initiated, but its not been easy. Most of the students don't even pay attention to half of what I'm trying to convey... ðŸ¤•

But hey, success lies behind challenges and every challenge is an extra stepping stone to my ultimate goal :)

Let's see what I can do... Even if I fail, I can proudly say that "I tried"!
