I love exploring other people's projects but one thing that annoys me the most is the lack of README file. Whenever I visit a repo, I expect it to have a comprehensible introduction to the code base.

Sometimes people take it too far too... Adding unnecessary badges, icons, etc. I know that just like any other art forms, building a beautiful yet informative README is hard and is subjective. But one should always try to keep the introduction accessible for the public.
