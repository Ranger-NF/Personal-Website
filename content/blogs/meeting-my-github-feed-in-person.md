This past week, I got to attend IndiaFOSS 2025 in Bengaluru (NIMHANS Convention Centre - India), one of the largest FOSS meetups run annually by FOSS United.

I attended talks about projects like Plane, HUML, Zasper, Ente, Frappe studio, LibreFin, Pratham Books (StoryWeaver) and more‚Äîplus other interesting sessions, which included a talk about FOSDEM (The largest Open Source conference on Earth), 'understanding how the universe works by treating it like a distributed system' by Aftab S and my personal favorite: ‚ÄúOpensource is a gift economy‚Äù by Chad Whitacre.

But it wasn‚Äôt just talks. I met so many awesome people who share the same love and passion for open source. Our whole GECP crew was there: Vishnu Sanal T, Viswanatha Kartha V, Vipin K P, Sherhin Shoukath, Anaswara T Rajan, Uvais J, Mohamed Nihal T K N, Abhishek S, Harikrishnan Rajesh and ABHINAV KRISHNA.P. And of course, my fellow TinkerHub campus leads and makers - the whole fam were there with me: Sabari VIjayan, Abhiram P, Abhijith B, Adithyan K, Caine Benoy, Shaan Shoukath, Aaromal A‚Ä¶ the list goes on.

Huge thanks to TinkerHub for covering my event ticket through their scholarship program‚Äîinitiatives like this help folks like me tick things off their bucket list. (Yep, attending IndiaFOSS was one of them.)

And honestly, it wasn‚Äôt just the event that made it memorable‚Äîit was getting to explore Bengaluru, meet its people, enjoy the culture, and, of course, the food. I love exploring, and this trip was the perfect opportunity. Walking from auditoriums to booths, and later wandering the streets at night, every step felt like it was expanding my perspective‚Äîbroadening not just my knowledge of FOSS, but also my understanding of the world around me.
