This is a whimsical little gadget that turns temperature into tunes—because why *feel* the weather when you can *hear* it?

Let’s be honest: checking the temperature is *way* too much effort. Who has time to glance at a thermometer or—god forbid—step outside? This project solves a problem *nobody* asked for by converting boring old temperature readings into delightful melodies. You’re welcome.

### The Solution (Because Why Not?)
We hooked up a DHT11 sensor to a NodeMCU, made it whisper temperature data to a PC over Wi-Fi, and  computer plays custom tunes based on how hot or cold it is. Hot day? Here’s a tropical vibe. Chilly night? Enjoy some cozy lo-fi. It’s absurd, it’s unnecessary, and it’s 100% fun.

**Hardware:**
- **NodeMCU v1 (ESP8266)** – The brain that complains about the weather
- **DHT11 Sensor** – The snitch that reports temperature to the system

### **How It Works (Magic, Basically)**
1. **Sensor Spills the Tea:** The DHT11 reads the temperature and sends it to `ntfy` (a simple pub-sub service).
2. **PC Listens In:** A Node.js script subscribes to the temperature updates via WebSocket.
3. **DJ Mode Activated:** Depending on the temp, your computer plays the perfect soundtrack—like a weather-dependent Spotify playlist, but *way* more extra.

**Why?** Because engineering should be playful. And because we *could*. 😉
