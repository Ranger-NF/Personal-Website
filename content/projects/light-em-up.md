A chaotic, LED-smashing whack-a-mole game powered by NodeMCU—because sometimes you just need to hit things with lights.

### The Problem (That We Invented for Fun)
Ever felt like your life lacked *instant gratification* from violently whacking random blinking lights? Us too. So we built this absurdly satisfying hardware game where you compete to smash LEDs faster than your friends (or enemies).

### The Solution (Pure Button-Mashing Joy)
Two players. One NodeMCU. A grid of LEDs that light up randomly. Your mission? **Punch the button** when your color flashes. Points stack, tempers flare, and friendships are tested.

### **Technical Wizardry**
**🛠️ Hardware:**
- **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** – The brain that trolls players with blinking lights
- **LED grid** – The victims
- **Arcade buttons** – For aggressive catharsis

**🔥 Features:**
- Real-time score tracking (smugness included)
- Randomized LED patterns (for maximum chaos)
- Public server mode (trash-talk strangers online)

Play at your own risk. May cause addictive button-slamming. 🔥
