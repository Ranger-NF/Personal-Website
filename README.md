This is the code behind justfahad.me — my little corner of the internet. It's a clean, simple website where I share who I am, what I do, and the cool things I’ve built or worked on.

I made this site to be fast, minimal, and easy to explore. No clutter, no fancy distractions — just me, my projects, and links to stuff I care about.

🚀 Live Website: https://justfahad.me

> 🏗 Made using [Vite React](https://vite.dev/)
